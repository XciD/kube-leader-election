# Leader Election Tests

All tests require a running Kubernetes cluster and `kubectl` to be present, pointed to the test cluster.

You can create a local cluster from the root using `just start-test-cluster`; requires [`docker`](https://docker.com), [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) and [`k3d`](https://k3d.io).
